# NodeJS Basics

## 0. Executing basic javascript with Node JS
In the file `0-console.js`, create a function named `displayMessage` that prints in `STDOUT` the string argument.

## 1. Using Process stdin
Create a program named `1-stdin.js` that will be executed through command line:

    - It should display the message `Welcome to Holberton School, what is your name?` (followed by a new line)
    - The user should be able to input their name on a new line
    - The program should display `Your name is: INPUT`
    - When the user ends the program, it should display `This important software is now closing` (followed by a new line)

## 2. Reading a file synchronously with Node JS
Using the database `database.csv` (provided in project description), create a function `countStudents` in the file `2-read_file.js`

    - Create a function named `countStudents`. It should accept a path in argument
    - The script should attempt to read the database file synchronously
    - If the database is not available, it should throw an error with the text `Cannot load the database`
    - If the database is available, it should log the following message to the console `Number of students: NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS`
    - It should log the number of students in each field, and the list with the following format: `Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES`
    - CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!

## 3. Reading a file asynchronously with Node JS
Using the database `database.csv` (provided in project description), create a function `countStudents` in the file`3-read_file_async.js`

    - Create a function named `countStudents`. It should accept a path in argument
    - The script should attempt to read the database file asynchronously
    - The function should return a Promise
    - If the database is not available, it should throw an error with the text `Cannot load the database`
    - If the database is available, it should log the following message to the console `Number of students: NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS`
    - It should log the number of students in each field, and the list with the following format: `Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES`
    - CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!

## 4. Create a small HTTP server using Node's HTTP module
In a file named 4-http.js, create a small HTTP server using the http module:

    - It should be assigned to the variable `app` and this one must be exported
    - HTTP server should listen on port 1245
    - Displays `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body for any endpoint as plain text

## 5. Create a more complex HTTP server using Node's HTTP module
In a file named `5-http.js`, create a small HTTP server using the `http` module:

    - It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
    - HTTP server should listen on port 1245
    - It should return plain text
    - When the URL path is `/`, it should display `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body
    - When the URL path is `/students`, it should display `This is the list of our students` followed by the same content as the file `3-read_file_async.js` (with and without the database) - the name of the database must be passed as argument of the file
    - CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!
